# Bomb Diffusing.

This is a simple game in Java where the user has to guess a random number between 1 and 5, and has 5 attempts to do so. If the user guesses correctly,
they win the game, otherwise the bomb "explodes" and the game ends. Before starting the game, the user enters their name, which is used to keep track of their score.
